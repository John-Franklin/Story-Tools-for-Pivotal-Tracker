Story Tools for Pivotal Tracker is a Google Chrome application, much more easily downloadable here:

This is just here to keep all of the code viewable from GitHub.

As a note, this code has been obsoleted by a UI change to Pivotal Tracker that changes the UI significantly. While the code underneath the program still works, the parts of the menu bar and the url have both been changed requiring an update at some point in the future.
